# What is this?
We are benchmarking the ability for different models to give correct answers to Agronomy questions. 

# Why?
When building new models for agriculture, it's important to know if you are getting better or worse. This is a simple benchmark to acoomplish this.

# Roadmap
1. Add short and long answer questions (to be evaluated against example correct answers)
2. Add questions for international regions
3. Add more models to the leaderboard
